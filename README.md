## bioinformatics
A collection of scripts to perform various bioinformatics applications.

### SNPs4BurdenTests.pl

This script creates SNP and genotype input files for [MONSTER](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24248908) to perform 
collapsing rare variant testing. User can specify a list of genes, desired GENCODE annotation, connected regulatory feature types,
scoring and weighting method, MAF/MAC thresholds. For more information about the usage and the accepted parameters of 
this script see the POD documentation at the end of the file.
